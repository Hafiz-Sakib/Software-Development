\section{Future Work}
While the current version of the \textbf{Odyssey Travel Agency Software} meets its initial goals effectively, there remain several promising directions for future enhancements. These improvements aim to further enrich the user experience, improve operational efficiency, and expand the system’s capabilities.

One potential improvement is the integration of \textit{AI-powered recommendation systems}, which would suggest personalized travel packages based on user preferences, booking history, and trending destinations. This would significantly enhance customer engagement and satisfaction.

Additionally, implementing \textit{multilingual support} would make the platform accessible to a broader international audience, improving inclusivity and market reach. Another valuable feature would be the inclusion of \textit{advanced analytics dashboards}, providing administrators with deeper insights into customer behavior, booking trends, and revenue forecasts.

Moreover, expanding the payment gateway to include more international and localized options would offer greater flexibility to users worldwide. Enhanced security measures, such as two-factor authentication and fraud detection systems, could further fortify user trust and data integrity.

In the long term, a \textit{mobile application} version of the system could be developed, allowing users to make and manage bookings on the go, thereby increasing overall accessibility and convenience.

By incorporating these future developments, the Odyssey Travel Agency Software can evolve into a fully-featured, intelligent, and globally competitive travel management platform.
