Cassava, a vital crop in many developing countries, is highly susceptible to several leaf diseases that negatively affect yield and food security. Traditional disease identification methods are time-consuming, costly, and often inaccessible to smallholder farmers. This study proposes a deep learning-based approach for classifying cassava leaf diseases using a publicly available image dataset. Several state-of-the-art transfer learning models were evaluated, including Xception, EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, VGG16, DenseNet121, and InceptionV3. Through comparative analysis, the Xception model achieved the highest classification accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing subtle visual differences in infected leaves. Data augmentation and preprocessing techniques were applied to enhance model performance. The findings suggest that deep learning can provide a reliable, scalable, and low-cost solution for early plant disease detection, potentially aiding farmers in timely decision-making and contributing to food security.
