The “Odyssey Travel Agency Software” is a full-stack web application designed to simplify and enhance the travel booking process for users and administrators alike. Users can register, browse country-specific tour packages, select desired packages, choose flight and hotel preferences, and proceed to book through a secure payment gateway. The frontend leverages HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and Next.js for a responsive and interactive user experience, while the backend is powered by Laravel and MySQL for efficient data processing and management. The admin interface allows CRUD operations on tour packages and facilitates the addition of local tour guide details. The system is developed following core software engineering principles such as modularity, scalability, and user-centric design, ensuring the product is both robust and maintainable for long-term use.
