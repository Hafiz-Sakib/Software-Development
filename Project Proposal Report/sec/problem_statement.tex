\section{Problem Statement}
Currently, many travel agencies rely on outdated methods of booking and managing tour packages, often involving manual processes that can lead to inefficiencies, errors, and poor customer experience. Existing online systems may offer basic functionalities, but they frequently lack seamless integration between package selection, customization (e.g., flight and hotel preferences), and secure payment processing. Furthermore, the administrative management of packages and tour guide information is often cumbersome and not easily accessible.

This project aims to address these gaps by developing a user-friendly Travel Agency website that provides a fully integrated platform for browsing, selecting, and booking tour packages. The system will streamline the entire process, from browsing available options to customizing travel details and completing payment securely. Additionally, it will provide administrators with a robust interface to efficiently manage tour packages and local tour guide information. By addressing these challenges, this project will significantly improve the overall travel booking experience, making it more efficient for both customers and administrators.
